    "title": "Olympus Mons",
    "description": "Olympus Mons is the most extreme volcano in the solar system. Located in the Tharsis volcanic region. Its height of 25 kilometers makes it nearly three times the height of Earth's Mount Everest, which is about 8.9 km high.\nOlympus Mons is a gigantic shield volcano, which was formed after lava slowly crawled down its slopes. This means that the mountain is probably easy for future explorers to climb, as its average slope is only 5 percent. At its summit is a spectacular depression about 85 km wide, formed by magma chambers that lost lava and collapsed.",

    "title": "Tharsis volcanoes",
    "description": "With Olympus Mons as its' most impressive feature there are also more volcanoes in the area. Tharsis hosts 12 gigantic volcanoes in a zone roughly 4000 km wide. Like Olympus Mons, these volcanoes tend to be much larger than those on Earth, presumably because Mars has a weaker gravitational pull that allows the volcanoes to grow taller. These volcanoes may have erupted for as long as two billion years, or half of the history of Mars.",

    "title": "Valles Marineris",
    "description": "Mars also hosts the largest canyon in the Solar System. Valles Marineris is roughly 3000 km long. That's about four times longer than the Grand Canyon.\nResearchers aren't sure how Valles Marineris came to be, but there are several theories about its formation. Many scientists suggest that when the Tharsis region was formed, it contributed to the growth of Valles Marineris. Lava moving through the volcanic region pushed the crust upward, which broke the crust into fractures in other regions. Over time, these fractures grew into Valles Marineris.",

    "title": "Gale Crater and Mount Sharp (Aeolis Mons)",
    "description": "Made famous by the landing of the Curiosity rover in 2012, Gale Crater is host to extensive evidence of past water. Curiosity discovered complex organic molecules in the region and also found that methane concentrations in the atmosphere change over the seasons. Methane is an element that can be produced by microbes, as well as geological phenomena, so it's unclear if that's a sign of life.",

    "title": "Hale Crater",
    "description": "Mars is host to strange features called recurring slope lineae (RSL), which tend to form on the sides of steep craters during warm weather. It's hard to figure out what these RSL are, though. Pictures from Hale Crater and some other locations show spots where spectroscopy picked up signs of hydration. The RSL could be also formed from atmospheric water or dry flows of sand. It's possible that it hosts alien microbes.",

    "title": "Noctis Labyrinthus and Hellas basin",
    "description": "Mars is a planet mostly shaped by wind these days, since the water evaporated as its atmosphere thinned. But we can see extensive evidence of past water, such as regions of 'ghost dunes' found in Noctis Labyrinthus and Hellas basin. Researchers say these regions used to hold dunes that were tens of meters tall. Later, the dunes were flooded by lava or water, which preserved their bases while the tops eroded away.\nOld dunes such as these show how winds used to flow on ancient Mars.",
